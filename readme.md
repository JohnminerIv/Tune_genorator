# Focus Tunes (In progress)

## Use this to generate music on the go.

The goal of this project was to generate music indefinitely from the initial starting
point of a small clip of sound. Initialy I did a lot of reasearch considering the
type of audio to use. I did see a lot of other projects out there using midi file
type to generate music with success. But around this time Milad one of my teachers
recommened that I look into mel-spectrograms which can be used to identify sounds
and music genres. So I thought I'd try to use them tho generate audio as well. It doesn't
work to well right now but I'll keep updating this and hopefully generate a working model
that you'll be able to use soon.

to see how the model(s) were created.
